Regarding the logger program, you must properly 
set the MOTECOM variable before running.

For example:
	export MOTECOM=serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb

Where '/dev/ttyUSB0' is the the mote's mount point (this
can be found by executing the 'motelist' command that is
included with TinyOS).

Once the MOTECOM variable is set, you can start the logger with:

	java -jar logger.jar

from the same directory. The program will begin to listen for
state changes coming from the red mote which should be connected
serially.
